1. Included Files
-------------------------------

This package contains two animation files, stored in
portal\models\player\ and one Portal Gun world model,
stored in portal\models\weapons\. The animation files are
male_anims.mdl and female_anims.mdl, for use with male
and female models, respectively. The world model is
modified to be compatible with both the original Chell model
and any ValveBiped model. All of these files are stored
within ValveBipedAnims.vpk, which can either be extracted
or installed as is.

-------------------------------
2. Installation & Use
-------------------------------

To install, navigate to your Steam folder and find your
portal folder. Navigate to your custom folder, or create it if
necessary, and extract ValveBipedAnims.vpk to this folder.

In order to use this, you will need a model with the ValveBiped
rig (any G-Mod, CS:S, DOD:S, Obsidian Conflict, etc. player
model, most NPC models), and will need to have knowlege of
compiling and, in the case of models already compiled,
decompiling. All you have to do to make the models useable in
Portal is change the $includemodel lines to include either
player\male_anims.mdl or player\female_anims.mdl, and compile
the model as player\chell.mdl.

-------------------------------
3. Extra Files
-------------------------------

Available seperately from this packages are compatibility files
for use with playermodels compiled for Garry's Mod. These models
are available either at the links included below, or, if unavailable there,
in the description of the file on whatever site you may have downloaded
if from, assuming this isn't a redistribution.

These files allow for the use of Garry's Mod playermodels without
recompiling, instead only requiring the header of an existing model
to be modified.
